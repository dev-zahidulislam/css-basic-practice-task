        <p>There are three main ways to apply CSS in a web project: inline CSS, internal CSS, and external CSS. Inline CSS is applied directly inside HTML elements, internal CSS is written within the style tag in the head section, and external CSS is stored in a separate file. Practicing all three methods helps beginners understand how CSS works, how styles override each other, and which approach is best suited for real-world web development projects.</p>
