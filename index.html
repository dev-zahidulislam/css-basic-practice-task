        <p>Cascading Style Sheets, commonly known as CSS, play a vital role in modern web development. CSS is responsible for controlling the visual presentation of a website, including colors, fonts, spacing, and layout structure. Without CSS, web pages would appear plain and unattractive, making it difficult to engage users. Learning how to apply CSS styles properly helps developers create visually appealing and user-friendly interfaces that work smoothly across different devices and screen sizes.</p>

        <p>There are three main ways to apply CSS in a web project: inline CSS, internal CSS, and external CSS. Inline CSS is applied directly inside HTML elements, internal CSS is written within the style tag in the head section, and external CSS is stored in a separate file. Practicing all three methods helps beginners understand how CSS works, how styles override each other, and which approach is best suited for real-world web development projects.</p>
